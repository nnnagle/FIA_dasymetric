Consider the problem of producing official small area estimates or maps from a sample survey.
The example we consider is producing small area estimate and maps from the United States Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program.
The FIA collects numerous response variables ($y$) on a fixed spatial network of sites through field survey and manual intepretation of remotely sensed imagery.
After poststratification, FIA estimates are intended to be representative at the state-level, or perhaps for estimation units comprising multiple states.
We use the term "small area" to represent any spatial region that is smaller than intended for use by the survey design.
For the FIA, a small area may represent a single county, or even a pixel or group of pixels on a map.
